# Observer Request Manager

This repository houses a TypeScript-based Request Manager built around the Observer design pattern. It provides a simple, yet powerful way to handle API requests and state changes in modern JavaScript applications.

## Key Features

-   **Observer Pattern**: The design pattern behind this manager promotes good coding practices and provides a robust system for tracking request states.
-   **State Management**: Handle state changes in your app gracefully. Our manager lets you track the status of your requests from loading to completion, making debugging easier.
-   **API Utilities**: We provide utility functions to interact with specific API endpoints, further simplifying the process of sending requests and handling responses.
